# AI Security Agent Architecture Design: SecureCode AI

## Overview
The SecureCode AI agent is designed to validate AI-generated code, dependencies, and vulnerabilities in real-time, with a focus on low false positives (<1%), auto-fixes, and seamless integration into developer workflows. Based on the product requirements from the PRD, discussions with Aaron, Tomas, and Jeffrey, and market landscape analysis, the system prioritizes:

- **Core Functionality**: Scan codebases (in-house and third-party dependencies) for AI-specific risks (e.g., hallucinations in vibe-coded packages, exposed endpoints, LLM injection), detect issues, and propose auto-fixes via PRs.
- **Key Goals**: Superior accuracy, low-friction PLG (e.g., GitHub App integration, free public repo scans), multi-language support (JS/Python initially, expandable), and compliance documentation (e.g., SOC2).
- **Assumptions**: 
  - Execution on differentiation: <1% false positives via specialized AI models.
  - Token/usage-based pricing aligned with code volume.
  - Initial MVP targets startups/SMBs (vibe-coders using Supabase/Lovable), scaling to enterprises.
  - Risks mitigated: High accuracy to avoid alert fatigue, integration with ecosystems like GitHub/Copilot.
- **Scope**: MVP focuses on scanning, detection, and fixes for AI-vulns in code/dependencies; future phases add LLM injection detection, compliance audits, and global push (NA/EU/APAC).

The architecture follows a modular, microservices-based design for separation of concerns (e.g., scanning agent vs. integration layer), enabling agent specialization as discussed. It leverages AI agents for modularity, with PLG hooks for viral growth (e.g., free scans demo value).

## High-Level Components
The system is divided into frontend, backend, AI core, and integration layers, deployed on cloud infrastructure for scalability.

## Data Flow
1. **Onboarding/Scan Initiation**:
   - User connects repo via GitHub OAuth (PLG: Free scan on public repos).
   - API Gateway authenticates and triggers Scan Orchestrator.

2. **Code Ingestion**:
   - Clone repo or fetch via API (e.g., GitHub).
   - Extract dependencies (e.g., parse package.json/requirements.txt).

3. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Queue tasks: AI Agent scans in-house code for AI-specific risks (e.g., hallucinations, insecure endpoints per Reddit summary).
   - Dependency Analyzer graphs and scans external packages for compounding risks (e.g., vibe-coded vulns).
   - Hybrid approach: Rule-based checks (e.g., Supabase RLS deny-by-default) + AI for contextual detection.

4. **Detection & Fix Generation**:
   - AI Agent outputs: Vuln reports with severity (high/medium/low), evidence (code snippets).
   - Auto-Fix Generator proposes diffs; if complex, flag for human/AI collaboration.

5. **Output & Integration**:
   - Results to Dashboard/PR (e.g., auto-create GitHub PR with fixes).
   - Compliance docs auto-generated (e.g., vuln prevention log).
   - Webhooks notify on new commits for continuous monitoring.

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User reviews/accepts fixes; system logs for model fine-tuning (reduce false positives).

                                Auto-Fix Generator --> Database/Storage
                                    |
                                    v
                                Output: PR/Report --> Compliance Engine
```

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python (core AI/backend), JS/TS (frontend/integrations).
- **AI/ML**: Anthropic Claude (code review), PyTorch (fine-tuning for accuracy), LangChain (agent orchestration). Hybrid: Integrate Snyk-like rules for baseline, AI for advanced (e.g., un-reviewed AI code detection).
- **Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP (EC2 for compute, Lambda for serverless scans, EKS for orchestration). Docker/Kubernetes for microservices.
- **Security**: Encrypt code in transit (TLS), at rest (S3 encryption). Role-based access (e.g., deny unauth scans). Self-host option for enterprises.
- **DevOps**: CI/CD via GitHub Actions, Terraform for IaC. Focus on low TCO (usage-based scaling).

## Scalability & Performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Microservices allow independent scaling (e.g., add AI Agent workers for large scans).
- **Efficiency**: Batch processing for dependencies; cache common packages. Target: 5-min fixes for small repos, <30 min for enterprise.
- **Metrics**: Monitor token volume (per Aaron's token economy), false positive rate (<1%), scan throughput (10x faster than manual).
- **Growth Handling**: PLG virality via free scans; auto-scale to 500 SMBs (MVP) to 3K enterprises ($100M ARR phase).

## Security & Reliability
- **Internal Security**: Agent runs in isolated containers; no code execution on user data.
- **Accuracy Mitigation**: Start with 97% true positives (per Qwiet AI benchmark); fine-tune on datasets like CVE + AI-hallucination examples.
- **Contingencies**: Fallback to manual review flags; audit logs for all scans. Handle edge cases (e.g., multi-lang) via phased support.
- **Risks**: Execution on accuracy (mitigate via iterative testing); competition (differentiate with auto-fixes, PLG).
