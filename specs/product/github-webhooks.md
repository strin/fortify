# GitHub Webhook Integration - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The GitHub Webhook Integration enables automatic, real-time security scanning of code changes through GitHub's webhook system. This feature transforms Fortify from a manual, on-demand scanning tool into a continuous security platform that integrates seamlessly with developer workflows.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Manual scanning friction**: Developers must remember to manually trigger scans
- **Delayed security feedback**: Security issues discovered long after code is written
- **Workflow disruption**: Context switching between coding and security scanning
- **Inconsistent coverage**: Some pull requests and commits never get scanned
- **Late-stage discovery**: Security vulnerabilities found after code is merged

### Business Impact
- Increased security vulnerabilities in production
- Developer productivity loss due to workflow friction
- Higher remediation costs for late-discovered issues
- Compliance gaps in security scanning coverage

## Product Vision

**Enable effortless, continuous security scanning that becomes an invisible but essential part of every developer's workflow - catching vulnerabilities the moment code is written, not days or weeks later.**

## User Stories

### Primary User: Developer
- **As a developer**, I want security scans to automatically run on every pull request so that I can catch vulnerabilities before code review
- **As a developer**, I want immediate feedback on security issues so that I can fix them while the code is fresh in my mind  
- **As a developer**, I want seamless integration with my existing GitHub workflow so that security doesn't slow me down
- **As a developer**, I want to see security scan results directly in my pull request so that I don't need to context switch to other tools

### Secondary User: Security Team
- **As a security engineer**, I want comprehensive coverage of all code changes so that nothing slips through without scanning
- **As a security engineer**, I want automatic enforcement of security scanning policies so that developers can't bypass security checks
- **As a security engineer**, I want visibility into which repositories and pull requests are being scanned so that I can track coverage

### Secondary User: Team Lead/Engineering Manager  
- **As a team lead**, I want security scanning to be automatic and non-disruptive so that my team maintains high velocity
- **As a team lead**, I want visibility into security scan results across my team's repositories so that I can track security posture

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption Metrics
- **Primary**: 80% of connected repositories have webhook integration enabled within 30 days
- **Primary**: 90% of pull requests in integrated repositories trigger automatic scans
- **Secondary**: Average time from PR creation to first scan result < 5 minutes

### User Experience Metrics  
- **Primary**: 95% of automatic scans complete successfully without user intervention
- **Primary**: Zero manual scan jobs created for repositories with webhook integration (indicates automatic coverage)
- **Secondary**: Developer satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0 for webhook-enabled workflows

### Security Impact Metrics
- **Primary**: 50% reduction in security vulnerabilities reaching main branch in integrated repositories
- **Primary**: 70% of security issues fixed within same pull request where detected
- **Secondary**: 3x increase in total security scans performed (due to automatic triggering)

## Functional Requirements
